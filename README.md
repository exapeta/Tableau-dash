TABLEAU PORTFOLIO ANALYSIS

Dashboard link: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/tab.leau3188/viz/MusicFormatUnits2010-2019/FormatDashboard#1

For this project, I looked at the total units for each Music format, with a dataset that spanned from 1973-2019. To provide a more concise look at the data, after prepping and organising it, I filtered the data to only show units since 2010. I then removed all formats that had had less than 1,000 units in the timeframe, to help form the dashboards that I wanted.

The visualisations display the top formats by units for each year, as well as the total units between 2010-2019. This help illustrates the most popular formats, and highlights key trends, such as the decline of the CD, and the sharp rise of streaming. These visualisations help to provide these insights.

Potential improvements: I would improve the layout of the dashboard, as although there's only two charts, I feel as though the layout could be better optimised. I'd also look at adding more information to the dashboard, as it's a bit limited in what it displays.
